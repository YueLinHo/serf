Release:


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

	We need code.  This project's goal is to create an http
	client library.

  * web pages (go to apr-site)

  * decide on prefix
      serf_ : +1 Greg, Aaron, Cliff
      aps_ :
      apr_serf_ :

  * decide on layout of the repository (e.g. subdirs)
    Greg thinks: prolly the following: /build, /include, /docs, /test, 
		 /core, and some for high-level items (maybe /filters
		 and /utils)

  * set up config/build structure based on apr-util
    (take this opportunity to simplify again; hopefully to fold these
     simplifications back into apr(-util))

  * release scripts (in /build) (and a how-to-release.txt in docs/)

  * turn docs/roadmap.txt into a real API/implementation design doc
    (at least far enough such that we can generate .h files and begin
     coding from there)

RELEASE NON-SHOWSTOPPERS BUT WOULD BE REAL NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:
