OPEN ISSUES

  * rather than having serf_bucket_alloc_t, can we make
    apr_allocator_t work "well" for bunches o' small allocations?

  * memory usage probably needs some thought. in particular, the mix
    between the bucket allocators and any pools associated with the
    connection and the responses. see the point below about buckets
    needing pools.

  * the current definition has a "metadata" concept on a per-bucket
    basis. however, to record this metadata, we really want to be able
    to use apr_hash_t, which implies having a pool.
    
    we do have a respool associated with the response. how does that
    get transferred to the individual buckets for their usage? what
    about the request side of things?
